# Customizing your information
{: #custom}

{{site.data.keyword.security-advisor_short}} pulls findings from other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} APIs such as Vulnerability Advisor and {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}}. For example, {{site.data.keyword.security-advisor_short}} might display findings of a server that is infected with malware, a container with vulnerabilities, and related metadata.
{:shortdesc}

Why would you want to create customizations? Say you have an application that is running a {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} cluster with the name `cloudkingdom`. One of the pods in the cluster is sending an abnormal amount of data to external servers. You want to capture this finding in your {{site.data.keyword.security-advisor_short}} dashboard.

You can use the API to:
  - Register new finding types
  - Map finding types by using metadata
  - Record occurrences of findings as KPIs and events

<br/>

## Customizing your information
{: #customizing}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.security-advisor_short}} API to customize the Network and Compute information that is displayed by making a post request to the API: `https://console.bluemix.net/apidocs/security-advisor`
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin**

*  Get your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account ID.
  ```
  ibmcloud account list org-account ORG_NAME [--guid]
  ```
  {: pre}
*  Retrieve your IAM token. The token is used in the `--header` of each API request.
  ```
  bx iam oauth-tokens
  ```
  {: pre}

**Customizing**

1.  Create a project by posting a `curl` request. Note the `id` in the response. You use it in the next step to target the project endpoint.

    Request:

    ```
    curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: <iam-token>'\
    -d '{ "id": "my-security-advisor", "name": "my-security-advisor", "shared": false }'\
    'https://console.bluemix.net/apidocs/security-advisor'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example response:

    ```
    {
      "id": "my-security-advisor",
      "name": "projects/my-security-advisor",
      "shared": false
    }
    ```
    {: screen}

2.  Create a `note` and give it an `id` such as `notes-2`. You use the ID in the next step to capture occurrences.

    Request:

    ```
    curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: <iam-token>' \
     -d '{
       "kind": "FINDING",

       },
       "finding":

                       }]
           }
       ,
       "short_description": "One of the pods in your cluster appears to be leaking an excessive amount of data",
       "long_description": "One of the pods in your cluster is approaching external servers and sending them data in volumes that exceed that podâ€™s normal behavior"
    }' 'https://console.bluemix.net/apidocs/security-advisor/projects/my-security-advisor/notes'
    ```

3.  Capture the `occurrences` of the finding. Replace `"<account-id>"` under `"context"` with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account ID.

    Request:

    ```
    curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: <iam-token>' \
     -d '{
