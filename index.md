- Vulnerabilities in container images that are stored in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}
- Suspicious clients and server IPs that communicate with a cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} (preview)

      <li>Select the {{site.data.keyword.security-advisor_short}} tile. A dashboard opens where you can view security information for the preconfigured integrated tools such as vulnerability advisor and certificate manager.</li>
