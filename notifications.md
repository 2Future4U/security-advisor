# Configuring notifications
{: #notifications}


By configuring an IBM Cloud Security Advisor notification channel you can be alerted to any reported vulnerabilities as soon as the report is available. With a fast alert time, you're able to immediately start an investigation into any reported issue and fix the vulnerability before it becomes a larger problem in your application. 
{: shortdesc}

By defining a process for handling alerts, you can ensure that you're in compliance and prepared if/when there is an issue. For example, some compliance standards require that issues must be responded to and closed within 24 hours, and the response is audited. With Security Advisor alerts in place, you are notified and can begin to resolve issues immediately.


## Before you begin
{: #notifications-before}

Before you get started with notifications, you must be assigned the proper IAM roles. Check out the following table to see which roles you need to perform which actions. For more information about roles, see [managing service access](/docs/services/security-advisor?topic=security-advisor-service-access).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Action</td>
    <td>Reader</td>
    <td>Manager</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>List channels</td>
    <td><img src="images/confirm.png" width="32" alt="Feature available" style="width:32px;" /></td>

## Configuring a notification method
{: #notification-method}


## Setting up a Slack Webhook
{: #notification-slack}

To set up a Slack Webhook, complete the following steps:

1. Sign up for [Slack](https://slack.com/) and set up your workspace.
2. Create a Slack channel where you want to post your notifications to.
3. [Set up a Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for the Slack channel.



### Setting up a Callback URL
{: #notification-callback}

You can use a Callback URL to post notifications to the tools that you use. For example, you can send notifications to report to PagerDuty, automatically open an issue in GitHub, or trigger renewal scripts.
{: shortdesc}

**Important:** Your Callback URL endpoint must meet the following requirements:
* The endpoint must use the HTTPS protocol.
* The endpoint must not require HTTP headers. This requirement includes authorization headers.
* The endpoint must return a `200 OK` status code to indicate a successful notification delivery.
